## Welcome to WeChef

Welcome to the culinary world, where chefs are artists crafting unique
dining experiences. Unlike traditional professions, chefs face a
challenge in sharing their portfolios. Culinary creations are fleeting,
existing in taste, aroma, and texture. In a world dominated by visual
platforms like LinkedIn, showcasing the essence of a chef's talent
becomes a unique hurdle. Beyond the final dish, a chef's artistry lies
in the meticulous process, precision, and artistic choices. Join us
in celebrating the culinary industry, where passion meets precision. Without a dedicated platform, we aim to create a space for chefs
to share their stories and connect. Let's appreciate the extraordinary
talents that make the culinary world truly exceptional.



A concept network where Chefs of all ranges can show their work and connect with others in the same industry. While LinkedIn is available, the restaurant industry relies on more of a visual concept.
## User
The user would be able to 
- Join the network
- Create, edit, and delete their profile
- View other chefs on the network, and search based on culinary role.
